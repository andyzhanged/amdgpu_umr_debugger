Added fakerizo which is a "fake" Carrizo so I could test the new
PCI detection logic which should be somewhat more future proof.

An example of using it would be 

umr -O bitsfull --pci 0000:00:01.0 -f @demo/npi/fakerizo -r *.*.mmGRBM_STATUS

This will work on systems where the Carrizo GPU is placed in that PCI topology
(it may vary on other implementations).
